## Credits

This course was partly inspired by: [https://github.com/geomar-tm/python-intro-201804/](https://github.com/geomar-tm/python-intro-201804/)

We downloaded sea-level data from: [PEGELONLINE](http://pegelonline.wsv.de)

We use annual-mean data from the [Baltic Sea-Ice Ocean Model BSIOM](https://portal.geomar.de/metadata/modelExperiment/show/349235).
